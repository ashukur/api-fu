# chat

This directory contains an example chat API. The API allows users to create accounts. Once they've created an account, they can create channels and post messages in those channels.

## Running

To serve up the API, you should `go generate ./... && go run main.go`. If you open the API in a browser, you'll have access to a GraphiQL interface where you can browse and exercise the API.
